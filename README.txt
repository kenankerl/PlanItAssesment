Pre-requisites needed:
- NodeJS
- Visual Studio Code

Install the dependencies first:
- Run "npm install" in the terminal.
- Run "npx playwright install" as well.

Scripts to run the tests can be found in the "package.json" file.
- Run "npm run sit:smoke" for example to check if the tests are running.

Notes: 
- Standard naming conventions:
    - Test files should be: "<moduleName>_<featureName>.spec.js".
